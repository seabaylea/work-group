### Initial Agenda:         
* Review Johannesâ€™ proposal, which includes:
  * HTTPHeaders as a struct, Body (stream) as a class
  * Access to the Body stream using async callbacks 
  * Link:           To be added

* Discussion points:
  * Use of struct for headers
    * Allows frameworks to be value-type based, or wrap in a class to be reference-type based
  * Sync vs. Async access to the body stream
    * Can we support both?
    * If not, should be be opinionated as state async, as Dispatch is the built-in concurrency approach?
